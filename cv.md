## Summary about myself
**My main goal** currently is to take on web-developer career! At the start of 2021, I finished my first Web-Development courses (3 months long), which introduced me to Web-Development, and I really liked the idea and work that developers do (even though I only touched easy parts of it), and as I continued to work as E-commerce development manager, I always thought about programming, and finally decided - that this is the year, to finally take this career path! I'm a fast learner, and have good critical / analytical thinking, which helps me to learn things quicker and easier.

**Touched programming languages:**
HTML/CSS (I know that it's not a language, but stil...);
C;
Python (Flask);
JavaScript (just vanilla, but will learn some React, TypeScript soon);

**Past Experiences:**
I haven't worked as developer previously, my last roles was **Purchasing Manager** at KESKO Senukai, **E-commerce development manager** at BisonOffice, and some individual activies, like selling on Amazon, eBay, Shopify etc...
